INTRODUCTION                                    *smartpairs*

This plugin tries to be smart about inserting pairings as you type.
By default, it will complete (), [], {}, '' and "".

For customizations, see |smartpairs-options|. 

INSERTING                                          *smartpairs-inserting*

The first thing smartpairs does is adding pairings as you type. So if you
type "(", it will automatically add a closing ")" for you. If you then
insert a space, it will add another one to pad it.

  You type    You get    Notes ~
  (           (_)        The "_" represents the cursor
  <Space>     ( _ )
